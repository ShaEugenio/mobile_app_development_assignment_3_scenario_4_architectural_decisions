# Payment Gateway Option

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We are deciding which payment gateway option is the most suitable for our transportation app. Our objective is to provide passengers with a simple yet secure payment method. We are considering aspects like security, usability, supported regions, and transaction costs to achieve this goal. It is essential that the payment gateway option we choose complies with the requirements of the transportation company and has the ability to process transactions in the regions where transportation services are offered. Additionally, we must take into account the various payment preferences and legal standards for accepted payment methods that vary by location.

## Decision
We have decided to integrate Stripe as the payment gateway for our transportation app. Stripe is an excellent choice for our security requirements because it offers a dependable and secure payment processing solution. Our passengers and drivers will benefit from a simple and seamless payment experience due to its intuitive API and well-established SDKs. Since Stripe is available in most locations, we can count on support in the areas where our transportation company operates. Additionally, its affordable transaction fees allow the company to effectively manage operating expenses.

## Consequences/Rationale
We will use Stripe as our payment gateway to ensure smooth and secure payment transactions. This decision prioritizes passengers' and drivers' security and convenience. With Stripe's extensive support across various regions, we can effectively cater users everywhere. The competitive transaction fees offered by Stripe will help the company achieve its cost-related goals and reduce app expenses. This choice not only helps financial operations but also simplifies the development process for our transportation app.
