# Backend Language

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We are deciding which language is best for our transportation app's back-end development. This decision will have an influence on the performance, scalability, and capabilities of our program to manage real-time communication.

## Decision
We have decided to use Node.js as the app's backend language.

## Consequences
We have chosen Node.js as our backend language to ensure a responsive experience and enable efficient handling of concurrent requests, real-time communication and locations, and scalability. It can connect to the necessary libraries. In addition to this, there is a huge community of developers and resources that could assist us in building this app.
