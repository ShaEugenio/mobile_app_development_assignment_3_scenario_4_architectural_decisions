# Encryption Technique

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We are deciding which encryption method to use for our transportation app to provide secure network communication and protect confidential user data. The right encryption method must be used in order to meet our security requirements while also protecting the privacy and integrity of user data throughout communication and storage. Encryption is essential for protecting data confidentiality and preventing unauthorized access and data breaches within the framework of our application.

## Decision
We have decided to implement Transport Layer Security (TLS) with a great encryption technique to secure the network connection in our transportation app. TLS offers an effective encryption layer that is important for ensuring secure communication and protecting data in transit. We will employ reliable encryption algorithms and protocols to maintain data integrity and confidentiality. TLS will be used to secure connections to our databases and to encrypt data transmission between the app and the server.

## Consequences/Rationale
We enable secure connection over networks by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) with strong encryption. This encryption method protects sensitive user data during data transmission which reduces the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. Passengers and drivers can be assured that their data is secure when using the app which increases their confidence in the app. TLS implementation also aligns with industry standards and best practices for data security and privacy, adding to the resilience of our security safeguards. In short, this step enhances the transportation app's security and ensures data protection.
