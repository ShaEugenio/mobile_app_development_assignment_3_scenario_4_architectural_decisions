# UI Framework

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We are deciding which is the most suitable User Interface (UI) framework for our transportation mobile app. Our goal is to create a user interface that looks simple, intuitive and highly responsive. The UI needs to meet the design objectives to enhance passengers' and drivers' usability.

## Decision
We have decided to use React Native to create the UI of our native mobile app.

## Consequences
React Native was chosen as our UI framework due to its potential for delivering an exceptional user experience. Despite our team's novice experience with React Native, we are enthusiastic about diving into the learning process and dedicating our utmost efforts to make the most of it. React Native is known to have strong performance track record and its wide developer community which can serve as a valuable resource. This community support will play a pivotal role in our learning journey and growth with this technology.
