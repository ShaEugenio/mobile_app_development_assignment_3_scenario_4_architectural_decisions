# Choosing App Type for Transportation Company

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We are deciding whether to create a hybrid, online, or native app for our transportation company. The main concern is providing a user-friendly experience for booking and tracking rides. The transportation company wants to ensure that everything works well and that users who book rides find it easy to use.

## Decision
We have decided to create a native mobile application.

## Consequences/Rationale
Users can be guaranteed high iOS and Android performance by choosing a native mobile app. However, this choice requires the creation and management of distinct codes for each platform. Nevertheless, it remains the best option due to the fact that the majority of our audience relies on mobile devices. This approach will enhance engagement and satisfaction among users as it caters to their platform preferences effectively.
