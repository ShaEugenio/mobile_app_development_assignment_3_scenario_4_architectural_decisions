# Permissions

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We are deciding the permissions needed for our transportation app. We have to determine what data and features drivers and passengers can specifically access. This is important because it will impact both drivers' and passengers' security, privacy, and user experience.

## Decision
We have decided to implement a role-based permission system with "Driver" and "Passenger" roles. In this way, each role will have different capabilities that will better suit their needs."

## Consequences
Implementing a role-based permission system improves access control management while still meeting our system needs. We can easily restrict data access and app functionality by making a distinction between the "Driver" and "Passenger" roles. This will provide proper access control and the protection of sensitive data but will require some expertise in authentication, authorization, and encryption.
