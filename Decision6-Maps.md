# Maps

## Status
Proposed

## Context
it is still on debate in which geolocation server provider is best suited for our transportation app. We have compared the Mapbox and Google maps based on the accuracy, coverage, and cost. In terms of accuracy and cost-effectiveness, it is shown that the Mapbox is more superior then Google, which make Mapbox more a compelling choice.

## Decision
We made a decision to use the Mapbox as our geolocation service provider since it is best suited for our transportation app. Although Google Maps was a good contender with some good features, Mapbox offers accuracy, coverage, and better alignment with our budget due to the Mapbox's price. With the decision we made, we are content of using Mapbox which meets the project's requirement. It is reliable and cost-effective when it comes to mapping services. 

## Consequences/Rationale
Since we decided to use Mapbox, we are expecting that we will have full access with accurate and reliable geolocation services for our transportation app. With this decision, it should help us meet the requirements which will provide the users with accurate routes, the drivers location, and estimated arrival time. It should also helps us manage costs effectively, in order to ensure that project remains within the budget.
